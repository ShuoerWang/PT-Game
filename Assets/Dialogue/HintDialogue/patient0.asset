  narration: Lucy Keen is a 24-year-old software developer with a one-month history
    of right calf pain. Pain began after falling down on ice, worsening over the
    past few days. She has been attending physiotherapy treatment over the past two
    weeks with little improvement in her symptoms. The subjective history and objective
    examination is consistent with chronic right lateral epicondylitis.
